# Model-predicting-the-WC-2022-winner

In this project I predicted the world winner by 66% which was Argentian and fortunently Argentina won it.
We used python scikit learn to predict the probability of winning, the model used was the Gradient Boosting.
The notebook begin with importing data : fifa ranking 2022 and match results from the beginning of football.
First some preprocessing and creating some new features and at last defining the Gradient boosting model.
